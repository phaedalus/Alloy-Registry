# Alloy-Registry
A collection of recognized compilers and engines that Alloy can use out the box.

All compilers listed in this registry must ship a **compiler.json** file and a **bridge/ directory** inside their release artifacts. Alloy relies on these files to communicate with the compiler runtime.
All engines listed in this registry must ship a **engine.json** file for the editor to understand it's structure.
